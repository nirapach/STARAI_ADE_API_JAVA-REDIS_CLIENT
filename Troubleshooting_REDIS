Follow these steps when NILS is restarted or Shutdown. I have written the scripts to load data in a single command.

Info Regarding ADE Pairs:

Step 1: 
Type the command  like this:
                 [nirapach@nils src]$   cd /home/projects/redis/redis-2.6.7/src/
Type the command "redis-server" in the console like this
                 [nirapach@nils src]$ redis-server

Note: This will start the redis server. Make sure to do this in a separate terminal, as it will not render back to the $ sign again. You can close the terminal which will affect the server.

Step 2:

To load Adverse drug event pair data onto the server back into the server, run the following script "run_redis.sh" from the location "/home/projects/pubmed"

Like this,
                [nirapach@nils pubmed]$ ./run_redis.sh

Note: This will take some time to finish, as the 'offsides' database takes more time.

Once this is done, you can query the database normally from the UI given to you by Vignesh.


Info Regarding Pubmed abstracts:
We have generated Pubmed abstracts for FDA, Medcanada and Offsides ADE pairs and they are present in the location in the following order in csv files.
/home/projects/pubmed/fda/outputfile/
/home/projects/pubmed/medcanada/outputfile/
/home/projects/pubmed/offsides/outputfile/
In case, you wish to generate the abstracts again, please follow Step 3. But this is not needed for the UI to perform normally.

Step 3:

To load Adverse drug event abstarcts from Pubmed, run the following script " run_extract_pubmed_abstracts.sh" from the location "/home/projects/pubmed"

Like this,

                [nirapach@nils]$ cd /home/projects/pubmed/

                [nirapach@nils pubmed]$ ./run_extract_pubmed_abstracts.sh

Note: This will take lot of time and processing power from NILS. Careful consideration needed if other jobs are running.


Please refer to the github projects for implementation guidelines regarding code change and reuse of the modules.
